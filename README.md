******Car Count Project******

This is the repository for my car count project, which is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to count the number of cars passing by a certain location and display the count on a web page.

**Demo**


You can experience a live demonstration of the Car Count Project by [visiting our demo page](https://shimmering-parfait-4933e8.netlify.app/).
